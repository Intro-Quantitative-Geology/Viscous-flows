*Figure 1. Schematic diagram of a viscous fluid flowing down an inclined plane.*

The velocity of a fluid flowing down an inclined plane can be modelled using some basic physical relationships. First, recall that the basal shear stress for a fluid flowing down an inclined plane is due to the down slope component of the weight of the overlying fluid

![Equation 13](Images/Equation13.png)

where *ρ* is the fluid density, *g* is the acceleration due to gravity, *h* is the thickness of the fluid perpendicular to the inclined plane and *α* is the angle of the plane with respect to horizontal. At any distance *z* above the bed

![Equation 14](Images/Equation14.png)

where *γ*<sub>*x*</sub> = *ρg*sin(*α*) is the downslope component of the gravitational force. Combining [Equation 2 from Part 1 of the theory](Exercise-5-theory-1.md) with Equation 14 we find the constitutive equation for a Newtonian fluid is

![Equation 15](Images/Equation15.png)

Integrating Equation 15 yields

![Equation 16](Images/Equation16.png)

where *c*<sub>1</sub> = 0 from the boundary condition *u* = 0 at *z* = 0. Equation 16 can be rewritten as

![Equation 17](Images/Equation17.png)

For a non-Newtonian fluid, Equation 14 can be modified to account for the case where the strain rate varies as a power of the shear stress ([Equation 7 from Part 1 of the theory](Exercise-5-theory-1.md))

To determine the velocity profile, we need to integrate Equation 18. If we use the boundary condition that the basal sliding velocity is equal to ub rather than zero, we get
