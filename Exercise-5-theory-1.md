*Figure 1. Schematic diagram of pressure-driven flow in a channel.*

The viscosity of ice depends on both temperature and stress. For simplicity, we’ll consider the case where viscosity is only a function of shear stress. Consider a channel of width *h* centered about *y* = 0, with lateral boundaries at *y* = ±*h*/2 (Figure 1). A pressure gradient *Δp* = *p*<sub>1</sub> - *p*<sub>0</sub> drives flow within the channel of length *L*.  The shear stress in the fluid depends on the applied pressure gradient and the distance from the channel boundaries

where *τ* is the shear stress. We know that for Newtonian fluids
